PLA is an implementation of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm. This algorithm will find a linear seperator for any linearly seperable dataset. 
Bias_Variance_Simulation simulates the bias and the variance of the linear hypothesis class (ax+b) when given two random training points on the x^2 function in the range (-1, 1). The out of sample error, bias, and variance can be calculated because the target function (x^2) is known. This simulation shows that out of sample error = bias + variance.
