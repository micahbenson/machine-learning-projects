Machine learning projects done for class at WashU. 
PLA is an implementation of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm. 
Bias_Variance_Simulation simulates the bias and the variance of the linear hypothesis class when given two points on the x^2 function in the range (-1, 1)
For bias variance simulation, out of sample error, bias, and variance can be calculated because the target function (x^2) is known.
